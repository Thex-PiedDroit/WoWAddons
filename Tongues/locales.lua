---provided by DonDumbo!
T_Common = "Gemeinsprache"
T_Draenei = BRAC2["Draenei"]
T_Orcish = "Orcisch" --(pretty often it's just the german way to pronounce the english "sh", as we add the c to it and make "sch" out of it)

T_Troll = "Trollisch" --= (I'll have to prove that, as I don't play horde characters yet)

--"Zandali" = (player language? If it's a troll dialect, you can leave that)

T_Dwarvish = "Zwergisch"

T_Gnomish = "Gnomisch"

T_Darnassian = "Darnassisch"

T_Forsaken = "Gossensprache"--"Vergessene" (I'll prove that. Should it not have been translated, it's still the german version of "Gutterspeak"..."Gossensprache")

T_Gutterspeak = "Gossensprache"

T_Taurahe = "Tauren" --(needs approval)

T_Thalassian = "Thalassisch" --(existed in Lore before it became an official language ;-))

T_Gilnean = "Gilneisch" --(no player language, since Gilnean speak only common. In the end they are human. But I prefer to use "Wolf" in shapeshifted form)


T_Nether = "Nether" --something i set up for warp stalkers (I wouldn't change that, as it's a pet language, and it wouldn't look different in german, hence for the mounts, they are called "Netherdrache")

T_Ursine = "Ursine" --= (player language?)

T_Kodo = "Kodo" --= (stays, like it is, as the Tauren mounts are called Kodo in german as well)

T_Wyvern = "Wyvern" --= (here I am in kind of a dispute...as wyvern are dragons...and german doesn't really differ here. You could say "Drachling", if it is for pets)

T_Seal = "Seehund" ---(never have seen seals in WoW only walrus... ;-))

T_Bird = "Vogel"

T_Ravenspeech = "Rabensprache"

T_Equine = "Equine" --(uhmm...player language? I'll have to prove that by playing horde characters ;-))

T_Binary = "Binar" --(german umlaut...I'll have to take a look for translating them to lua-code. As far as I remember it uses ATF-8 code)

T_Moonkin = "Mondkin" --(in early versions of WoW they used Moonkin as well...but Blizzard localized like crazy. We have even got Stormwind and Ironforge translated. You can't imagine, how hard long-time-players cursed Blizzard for that ;-))

T_Trentish = "Trentisch" --(You could as well short this to "Trent" for both languages)

T_DarkIron = "Dunkeleisen" --(Those guys are also called "Thaurassian", so you could use that in english, in german "Thaurassisch")

T_Kalimag = "Kalimag"  --(You can leave that, as it is the language of elementals, we use the same term in german)

T_Demonic= "Damonisch" --(since this is the same language the warlocks' companions use, it's still impossible for players to understand their pets, when those speak)

T_Eredun ="Eredun" --(Pre-Draenei...the fallen Draenei use this, so to say a demonic dialect ;-) We don't differ in german.)

T_Titan = "Titan" --(keep this, as it doesn't differ in german)

T_Draconic ="Drakonisch" ---or "Drachisch" (sometimes german is...weird :-D)

T_Nerubian = "Nerubisch"

T_Qiraji = "Qiraji" --= (keep it this way, as it only refers to the Qiraji mounts...though I'll have to prove, if we add an U to it...like "Quiraji")

T_Nerglish = "Nerglisch" --= (uhmm...player language? I'll have to take a deeper look into this ;-))

T_Nazja = "Nazja" --= (look one above...unless it's like Naga-tongue...)

T_Scourge = "Seuche" --= (I don't play horde characters, but I'll change that to help you as much as possible)
